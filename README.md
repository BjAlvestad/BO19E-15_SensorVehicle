## About The Project
This project was the bachelor thesis of Bj√∏rnar Alvestad, Benjamin Odland Skare and Erlend Lone at Western Norway University of Applied Science.
Our goal was to make a learining tool for engineering students at Western Norway University of Applied Science. The physical car we made has ultrasonic sensors and a LiDAR for measuring distance to obstacles and it has encoders that is used to determine the speed of the car and the distance travelled. HVL SensorVehicle Simulator was made so that the students could test their control logics without having the physical car present.


### Built With
**<u>SensorVehicle-main</u>**

* MVVM framework [Prism](https://prismlibrary.github.io/docs/)



**<u>Simulator-2D</u>**

* Game developement framework [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/)

* Map editor [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)

  

**<u>SensorVehicle-extras</u>**

* Starting point for webcam streaming [HttpWebcamLiveStream]  (https://github.com/SaschaIoT/HttpWebcamLiveStream/tree/master/HttpWebcamLiveStream)

  

## Getting Started
To fully use HVL SensorVehicle Main and write your own control logic you need to:
* Clone this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BjAlvestad/BO19E-15_SensorVehicle-Simplified.git
```
* Install HVL SensorVehicle Simulator from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/hvl-sensorvehicle-simulator/9nbs6gn8sqlg?activetab=pivot:overviewtab
* Open SensorVehicle-main.sln and navigate to one of the StudentXX.cs-files
